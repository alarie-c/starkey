# (SK) Starkey
A data-science programming langauge made to make the manipulation and handling of data precise, deliberate, and free of error.

## An explanation
> This repository was originally going to be used for `Lamuta` which was a separate language I was working on. I went a few days before deciding it was silly to work one these both at the same time. That said, the code for this was better than Starkey's most recent code, so I just renamed this repository to `Starkey`.
> For a more detailed history, see the `darcylang` repository activity, which was my 'original' repo for Starkey.
> Starkey has previous versions in my private repositories dating back to March of 2024, the oldest of which is `darcylang`, which is public here: `https://github.com/alarie-c/darcylang`
